# Gotta Hack Em All 
> `SOLVED`

all tha game summer training came in use. \
I had done an rpg maker VX question during summer training. \
So i saw the file `.rgssad` and realised this more or less the same thing. \
Its not really the same thing. \
This one was actually `rpg-maker XP` not `VX`. Both are different, took me a second to find that out.
I don't exactly remember what i did to figure that out, i think i just googled a lot.

## Approach -
there exists [`https://github.com/uuksu/RPGMakerDecrypter`](https://github.com/uuksu/RPGMakerDecrypter) \
It extracts game data (the scripts and stuff) and graphics stuff from a provided `.rgssad` \
You can make a new project with rpg maker XP, \
put the extracted files into it and do whatever you want. \
change the money, trigger events whatever u want. \
So i do exaactly that \
BUT IT WONT COMPILE \

I KEPT GETTING THIS \
I thought i was doing something wrong, I summoned Akash, he did exactly the same steps i told \
and yes. \

and he gets it. \

## Takeaways -
To this day, idk what happened \
even Akash doesn't. I did exactly the same stuff. \
Even after CTF i tried to solve this one. \
My RPG Maker would not compile the game. \
I would've solved this one prolly had i tried it on another system.

# Maze Runner 
> `SOLVED LATER`

Because the timewaste on the above chal, couldn't really get around to doing this one. \
This was cheat engine nothing else. \
Move up and down, side to side and look for increasing decreasing double values for the position coordinates. \
Once you get the coordinates, teleport around to look where the flag is at \

also you have to do this quickly and make sure u teleport to even numbered coordinates or the game crashes \
